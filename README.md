# Activity-Life-Cycle

As an activity transitions from state to state, it is notified of the change by calls to the following protected methods:

## void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
## void onStart()
## void onRestart()
## void onResume()
## void onPause()
## void onStop()
## void onDestroy()


These seven methods define the entire lifecycle of an activity.
